## Overview

WEN New Standard

WEN New Standard is a specification for representing NFTs using Token Extensions (TE). This specification is enforced and encoded through a program that currently addresses missing features such as token groups and setting up required extensions on TE.

WEN Royalty Distribution

WEN Royalty Distribution is a specification for royalties on WNS assets, which also enforces the payout of royalties through a Token Extension transfer hook.

## Building

To build the programs from the root directory of the repository:

```bash
yarn install
```

to install the required libraries, then:

```bash
anchor build
```

This will create program binaries at `<ROOT>/target/deploy/<program_name>.so` and IDLs at `<ROOT>/target/idl/<program_name>.json`.

## Testing

All program tests are located under the [`/tests`](./tests) directory:

```bash
anchor test
```

## Programs

This project contains the following programs:
